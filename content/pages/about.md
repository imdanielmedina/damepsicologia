I am a Colombian citizen, I have been preparing for the last 20 years to present something interesting to you in this moment in which you are reading about me, so I will start by saying that I am "a student of everything", I like to constantly learn and I consider that I chose the correct university career, since in psychology I can find new things every day and continue to learn in a practical and holistic way.

## **Credentials**

I am a psychologist in training at the Santo Tom√°s University, I am a technician in Business Consulting graduated from SENA, I am currently studying Digital Marketing at Platzi, I have 4 English certifications at SENA and 4 at Platzi English Academy. Finally, I am going to do professional internships in the clinical area of psychology and if you are reading this it is because I sent you my CV and I would like to work with you.

*Thank You for reading!*
