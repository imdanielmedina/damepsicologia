I am a Colombian citizen, I have been preparing for the last 20 years to present something interesting to you in this moment in which you are reading about me, so I will start by saying that I am "a student of everything", I like to constantly learn and I consider that I chose the correct university career, since in psychology I can find new things every day and continue to learn in a practical and holistic way
