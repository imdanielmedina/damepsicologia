#### Below are the main technical and soft skills that I have developed in my comprehensive training as a professional, which can be useful in fulfilling tasks related to psychological discipline.

# Planning

The clinical and health psychology requires that the professional have the ability to develop strategic and systematized plans for research, evaluation, intervention, and promotion and prevention projects.

# Evaluation

The knowledge of my training allows me to carry out psychological evaluation processes to recognize the nature of the problems that patients present and formulate an effective ABC's (Antecedent, Behavior, Consequence). In addition, I have the ability to use psychological evaluation tools such as systematic observation, interviews, self-registration and the application of psychometric tests.

# Intervention

I have knowledge in family and couples therapy applied to the clinical area and I did a psychological first aid course in Platzi.

# Professional ethics

I know the Colombian legal regulations for the practice of psychology, which is contained in law 1090 of 2006, resolution 8430 of 1993 and law 1581 of 2012 (Habeas Data).
